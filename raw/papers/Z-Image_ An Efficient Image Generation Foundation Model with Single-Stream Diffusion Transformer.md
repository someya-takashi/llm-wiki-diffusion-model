###### Abstract

The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro [^27] and Seedream 4.0 [^65]. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image [^77], Hunyuan-Image-3.0 [^8] and FLUX.2 [^37], are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the “scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle – from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum – we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

## 1 Introduction

The field of text-to-image (T2I) generation has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, evolving from generating rudimentary textures to producing photorealistic imagery with complex semantic adherence [^58] [^18] [^36] [^77] [^65] [^8] [^4]. However, as the capabilities of these models have scaled, their development and accessibility face significant barriers. The current landscape is increasingly characterized by two divergent trends: on one side, state-of-the-art commercial closed-source models – such as Nano Banana Pro [^27] and Seedream 4.0 [^65] – remain enclosed within “black boxes”, offering high performance but limited transparency or reproducibility. On the other side, open-source models, while fostering democratization, often resort to massive parameter scaling – approaching tens of billions of parameters (*e.g.*, Qwen-Image [^77] (20B), FLUX.2 [^37] (32B) and Hunyuan-Image-3.0 [^8] (80B) – imposing prohibitive computational costs for both training and inference. In this context, distilling synthetic data from proprietary models has emerged as an appealing shortcut to train high-performing models at lower cost, becoming a prevalent approach for resource-constrained academic research [^13] [^20]. However, this strategy risks creating a closed feedback loop that may lead to error accumulation and data homogenization, potentially hindering the emergence of novel visual capabilities beyond those already present in the teacher models.

In this work, we present Z-Image, a powerful diffusion transformer model that challenges both the “scale-at-all-costs” paradigm and the reliance on synthetic data distillation. We demonstrate that neither approach is necessary to develop a top-tier image generation model. Instead, we introduce the first comprehensive end-to-end solution that systematically optimizes every stage of the model lifecycle – from data curation and architecture design to training strategies and inference acceleration – enabling efficient, low-cost development on purely real-world data without distilling results from other models.

Most notably, this methodological efficiency allows us to complete the entire training workflow with remarkably low computational overhead. As detailed in Table 1, the complete training pipeline for Z-Image requires only 314K H800 GPU hours, translating to approximately $628K at current market rates (about $2 per GPU hour [^38]). In a landscape where leading models often demand orders of magnitude more resources, this modest investment demonstrates that principled design can effectively rival brute-force scaling.

Table 1: Training costs of Z-Image, assuming the rental price of H800 is about $2 per GPU hour. The rental price refers from [^38].

| Training Costs | Low-res. Pre-Training | Omni-Pre-Training | Post-Training | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| in H800 GPU Hours | 147.5K | 142.5K | 24K | 314K |
| in USD | $295K | $285K | $48K | $628K |

This breakthrough in cost-efficiency is underpinned by a systematic methodology built on four pillars:

- Efficient Data Infrastructure: In resource-constrained scenarios, an efficient data infrastructure is pivotal; it serves to maximize the rate of knowledge acquisition per unit of time – thereby accelerating training efficiency – while simultaneously establishing the upper bound of model capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a comprehensive Data Infrastructure composed of four synergistic modules: a Data Profiling Engine for multi-dimensional feature extraction, a Cross-modal Vector Engine for semantic deduplication and targeted retrieval, a World Knowledge Topological Graph for structured concept organization, and an Active Curation Engine for closed-loop refinement. By granularly profiling data attributes and orchestrating the training distribution, we ensure that the “right data” is aligned with the “right stage” of model development. This infrastructure maximizes the utility of real-world data streams, effectively eliminating computational waste arising from redundant or low-quality samples.
- Efficient Architecture: Inspired by the remarkable scalability of decoder-only architectures in large language models [^6], we propose a Scalable Single-Stream Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT). Unlike dual-stream architectures that process text and image modalities in isolation, our design facilitates dense cross-modal interaction at every layer. This high parameter efficiency enables Z-Image to achieve superior performance within a compact 6B parameter size, significantly lowering the hardware requirements for both training and deployment. The compact model size is also made possible in part by our use of a prompt enhancer (PE) to augment the model’s complex world knowledge comprehension and prompt understanding capabilities, further mitigating the limitations of the modest parameter count. Furthermore, this early-fusion transformer architecture ensures superior versatility by treating tokens from different modalities uniformly – including text tokens, image VAE tokens, and image semantic tokens – enabling seamless handling of diverse tasks such as text-to-image generation and image-to-image editing within a unified framework.
- Efficient Training Strategy: We design a progressive training curriculum composed of three strategic phases: (1) Low-resolution Pre-training, which bootstraps the model to acquire foundational visual-semantic alignment and synthesis knowledge at a fixed $256^{2}$ resolution. (2) Omni-pre-training, a unified multi-task stage that consolidates arbitrary-resolution generation, text-to-image synthesis, and image-to-image manipulation. By amortizing the heavy pre-training budget across these diverse capabilities, we eliminate the need for separate, resource-intensive stages. (3) PE-aware Supervised Fine-tuning, a joint optimization paradigm where Z-Image is fine-tuned using PE-enhanced captions. This ensures seamless synergy between the Prompt Enhancement module and the diffusion backbone without incurring additional LLM training costs, thereby maximizing the overall development efficiency of the Z-Image system.
- Efficient Inference: We present Z-Image-Turbo, which delivers exceptional aesthetic alignment and high-fidelity visual quality in only 8 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs). This performance is unlocked by the synergy of two key innovations: Decoupled DMD [^46], which explicitly disentangles the quality-enhancing and training-stabilizing roles of the distillation process, and DMDR [^32], which integrates Reinforcement Learning by employing the distribution matching term as an intrinsic regularizer. Together, these techniques enable highly efficient generation without the typical trade-off between speed and quality.

Building upon this robust foundation and efficient workflow, we have successfully derived two specialized variants that address distinct application needs. First, our few-shot distillation scheme with reinforcement learning yields Z-Image-Turbo, an accelerated model that achieves exceptional aesthetic alignment in just 8 NFEs. It offers sub-second inference <sup>1</sup> latency on enterprise GPUs and fits within the memory constraints of consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Second, leveraging the multi-task nature of our omni-pre-training, we introduce Z-Image-Edit, a model specialized for precise instruction-following image editing.

Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the Z-Image family. As illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, Z-Image delivers strong capabilities of photorealistic generation and exceptional bilingual (Chinese/English) text rendering, matching the visual fidelity of much larger models. Figure 3 showcases the capabilities of Z-Image-Edit, highlighting its precise adherence to editing instructions. Furthermore, qualitative comparisons in Figure 4 and Section 5.3 reveal that our model rivals top-tier commercial systems, proving that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly generative models.

## 2 Data Infrastructure

While the remarkable capabilities of state-of-the-art text-to-image models are underpinned by large-scale training data, achieving optimal performance under constrained computational resources necessitates a paradigm shift from data quantity to data efficiency. Simply scaling the dataset size often leads to diminishing returns; instead, an efficient training pipeline requires a data infrastructure that maximizes the information gain per computing unit. To this end, an ideal data system must be strictly curated to be *conceptually broad* yet *non-redundant*, exhibit *robust multilingual text-image alignment*, and crucially, be *structured for dynamic curriculum learning*, ensuring that the data composition evolves to match the model’s training stages. To realize this, we have designed and implemented an integrated Efficient Data Infrastructure. Far from a static repository, this system operates as a dynamic engine architected to maximize the rate of knowledge acquisition within a fixed training budget. As the cornerstone of our pipeline, this infrastructure is composed of four core, synergistic modules:

1. Data Profiling Engine: This module serves as the quantitative foundation for our data strategy. It extracts and computes a rich set of multi-dimensional features from raw data, spanning low-level physical attributes (*e.g.*image metadata, clarity metrics) to high-level semantic properties (*e.g.*, anomaly detection, textual description). These computed profiles are not merely for basic filtering; they are the essential signals used to quantify data complexity and quality, enabling the programmatic construction of curricula for our dynamic learning stages.
2. Cross-modal Vector Engine: Built on billions of embeddings, this module is the engine for ensuring efficiency and diversity. It directly supports our goal of a *non-redundant* dataset through large-scale semantic deduplication. Furthermore, its cross-modal search capabilities are critical for diagnosing and remediating model failures. This allows us to pinpoint and prune data responsible for specific failure cases and strategically sample to fill conceptual gaps.
3. World Knowledge Topological Graph: This structured knowledge graph provides the semantic backbone for the entire infrastructure. It directly underpins our goal of *conceptual breadth* by organizing knowledge hierarchically. Crucially, this topology functions as a semantic compass for data curation. It allows us to identify and fill conceptual voids in our dataset by traversing the graph to find underrepresented entities. Furthermore, it provides the structured framework needed to precisely rebalance the data distribution across different concepts during training, ensuring a more efficient and comprehensive learning process.
4. Active Curation Engine: This module operationalizes our infrastructure into a truly dynamic, self-improving system. It serves two primary, synergistic functions. First, it acts as a frontier exploration engine, employing automatic sampling to identify concepts on which the model performs poorly or lacks knowledge (“hard cases"). Second, it drives a closed-loop data annotation pipeline. This ensures that every iteration not only expands *conceptual breadth* of the dataset with high-value knowledge but also continuously refines the data quality, maximizing the learning efficiency of the entire training process.

Collectively, these components forge a robust data infrastructure that not only fuels the training of text-to-image models but also establishes a versatile infrastructure for broader multimodal model training. Leveraging this system, we successfully facilitate the training of various critical components, including captioners, reward models, and our image editing model (*i.e.*, Z-Image-Edit). In particular, we construct a dedicated data pipeline specifically for Z-Image-Edit upon this infrastructure, the details of which are elaborated in Section 2.5.

### 2.1 Data Profiling Engine

The Data Profiling Engine is engineered to systematically process a massive, uncurated data pool, comprising large-scale internal copyrighted collections. It computes a comprehensive suite of multi-dimensional features for each image-text pair, enabling principled data curation. Recognizing that different data sources exhibit unique biases, our engine supports source-specific heuristics and sampling strategies to ensure a balanced and high-quality training corpus. The profiling process is structured across several key dimensions:

##### Image Metadata.

We begin by caching fundamental properties for each image. This includes elementary metadata like resolution (width and height) and file size, which facilitate efficient filtering based on resolution and aspect ratio. Simultaneously, we compute a perceptual hash (pHash) from the image’s byte stream. This hash acts as a compact visual fingerprint, enabling rapid and effective low-level deduplication to remove identical or near-identical images. Together, these pre-computed attributes form the first layer of data selection.

##### Technical Quality Assessment.

The technical quality of an image is a critical determinant of model performance. Our engine employs a multi-faceted approach to quantify and filter out low-quality assets:

- Compression Artifacts: To identify over-compressed images, we calculate the ratio of the ideal uncompressed file size (derived from resolution and bit depth) to the actual file size. A low ratio indicates potential quality degradation due to excessive compression.
- Visual Degradations: We utilize an in-house trained quality assessment model to score images on a range of degradation factors, including color cast, blurriness, perceptible watermarks, and excessive noise.
- Information Entropy: To maximize the density of meaningful content seen during training, we filter out low-entropy images. This is achieved through two complementary methods: (1) analyzing the variance of border pixels to detect images with large, uniform-color backgrounds or frames, and (2) performing a transient JPEG re-encoding and using the resulting bytes-per-pixel (BPP) as a proxy for image complexity.

##### Semantic and Aesthetic Content.

Beyond technical quality, we profile the high-level semantic and aesthetic properties of images:

- Aesthetic Quality: We leverage an aesthetics scoring model, trained on labels from professional annotators, to quantify the visual appeal of each image.
- AIGC Content Detection: Following the findings of Imagen 3 [^3], we trained a dedicated classifier to detect and filter out AI-generated content. This step is crucial for preventing degradation in the model’s output quality and physical realism.
- High-Level Semantic Tagging: We have trained a specialized Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate rich semantic tags. These tags include general object categories, human-centric attributes (*e.g.*number of people), and culturally specific concepts, with a particular focus on elements relevant to Chinese culture. The same model also performs safety assessment by assigning Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) scores, allowing for the unified filtering of both semantically irrelevant and inappropriate content.

##### Cross-Modal Consistency and Captioning.

The alignment between an image and its textual description is paramount.

### 2.2 Cross-modal Vector Engine

We enhance the de-duplication method proposed in Stable Diffusion 3 [^18], reformulating it as a scalable, graph-based community detection task. Addressing the severe scalability bottleneck of the original $range\_search$ function, we substitute it with a highly efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) $search$ function. We construct a proximity graph from the k-NN distances and subsequently apply the community detection algorithm [^69]. This methodology closely approximates the original algorithm’s output for a sufficiently large k while drastically reducing time complexity. Our fully GPU-accelerated [^61] pipeline achieves a processing rate of approximately 8 hours per 1 billion items on 8 H800s, encompassing index construction and 100-NN querying. This approach not only ensures a non-redundant dataset by identifying dense clusters for effective de-duplication but also extracts semantic structures via modularity levels, facilitating fine-grained data balancing.

Furthermore, we constructed an efficient retrieval pipeline leveraging multimodal features [^87] combined with a state-of-the-art index algorithm [^55]. This system’s cross-modal search capabilities are critical for both data curation and active model remediation. Beyond identifying distributional voids for strategically sampling to fill conceptual gaps – thereby enabling targeted augmentation for a balanced pre-training distribution – this engine is instrumental in diagnosing model failures. By querying the system with failure cases (*e.g.*, problematic generated images or text prompts), we can pinpoint and prune the underlying data clusters responsible for the erroneous behavior. This iterative refinement process, targeting both data gaps and model failures, ensures dataset robustness and is pivotal for sourcing high-quality candidates for complex downstream tasks.

### 2.3 World Knowledge Topological Graph

The construction of our knowledge graph follows a three-stage process. Initially, we build a comprehensive but redundant knowledge graph from all Wikipedia entities and their hyperlink structures. To refine this graph, we employ a two-pronged pruning strategy: first, centrality-based filtering removes nodes with exceptionally low PageRank [^57] scores, which represent isolated or seldom-referenced concepts; second, visual generatability filtering uses a VLM to discard abstract or ambiguous concepts that cannot be coherently visualized. Subsequently, to address the limited conceptual coverage of the pruned graph, we augment it by leveraging a large-scale internal dataset of captioned images. We extract tags and corresponding text embeddings from all available captions. Inspired by [^72], we then perform an automatic hierarchical strategy on these embeddings. Each parent node is named by using a VLM to summarize its child nodes. This not only supplements the graph with new concept nodes but also organizes them into a structured taxonomic tree, significantly enhancing the structural integrity of the graph. In the final stage, we perform weight assignment and dynamic expansion to align the graph with practical applications. This involves manually curating and up-weighting high-frequency concepts from user prompts, and proactively integrating novel, trending concepts not yet present in our data pool to maintain the relevance and timeliness of the graph.

In application, this graph underpins our semantic-level balanced sampling strategy. We map the tags within each training caption to their corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph. By considering both the BM25 [^63] score of a tag and its hierarchical relationships (*i.e.*, parent-child links) within the graph, we compute a semantic-level sampling weight for each data point. This weight then guides our data engine to perform principled, staged sampling from the data pool, enabling fine-grained control over the training data distribution.

Figure 5: Overview of the Active Curation Engine. The pipeline refines uncurated data through cross-modal embedding, deduplication, and rule-based filtering to construct a high-quality augmented dataset. A feedback mechanism leverages the Z-Image model to diagnose long-tail distribution deficiencies, dynamically guiding cross-modal retrieval to reinforce the data collection process. The “Squirrel Fish” (松鼠鳜鱼) case illustrates a classic long-tail challenge: it is actually the name of a Chinese cuisine but the model lacks the specific concept for this dish and may rely on compositional reasoning (combining “Squirrel” (松鼠) and “Fish” (鳜鱼)), leading to erroneous generations absent of domain-specific training data.

### 2.4 Active Curation Engine

![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.22699/assets/active_learning.png)

Figure 6: Illustration of the Human-in-the-Loop Active Learning Cycle. Data sampled from the media pool undergoes concept and quality balancing before being assigned pseudo-labels. A dual-verifier system (Human and AI) filters these proposals: approved samples pass directly, while rejected cases trigger a manual correction phase. This feedback loop iteratively refines the annotations and updates the topology graph to ensure high-precision alignment.

To systematically elevate data quality and address long-tail distribution challenges, we deploy a comprehensive Active Curation Engine (Figure 5). This framework incorporates a filtering tool and Z-Image as a diagnostic generative prior. The pipeline begins by processing uncurated data through cross-modal embedding and deduplication, followed by rule-based filtering to eliminate low-quality samples.

To support the continuous evolution of Z-Image, we establish a human-in-the-loop active learning cycle (Figure 6) where the reward model and captioner are progressively optimized. In this pipeline, we first employ the topology graph (Section 2.3) and the initial reward model to curate a balanced subset from the unlabeled media pool. The current captioner and reward model then assign pseudo-labels to these samples. A hybrid verification mechanism – comprising both human and AI verifiers – verifies these proposals; rejected samples trigger a manual correction phase by human experts to refine captions or scores. This high-quality annotated data is then used to retrain the captioner and reward model, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of our whole data infrastructure enhancement.

### 2.5 Efficient Construction of Editing Pairs with Graphical Representation

Figure 7: Data construction for image editing using different strategies: (a) arbitrarily permuting and combining different edited versions of the same input image where the green arrow represents the pair constructed by task-specfic expert models and the red arrow denotes the pair generated by combination and permutation, (b) collecting images with inherent relationship from video frames, and (c) controllable text rendering system for text editing.

Collecting editing pairs that exhibits precise instruction following is challenging, owing to the requirement of consistency maintaining and the diverse and complex nature of editing operations. Through scalable and controllable strategies as shown in Figure 7, we construct a large-scale training corpus from diverse sources.

Mixed Editing with Expert Models. To guarantee broad task coverage, we begin by curating a diverse taxonomy of editing tasks, and then leverage task-specific expert models to synthesize high-quality training data for each category. To improve the training efficiency, we construct mixed-editing data, where multiple editing actions are integrated into one editing pair. Thus, the model can enhance its ability in multiple editing tasks from only a single composite pair, instead of relying on multiple ones.

Efficient Graphical Representation. For an input image, we synthesize multiple edited versions corresponding to different editing tasks, enabling us to further scale the training data at zero cost through arbitrary pairwise combination [^42] (*e.g.*, 2 $\tbinom{N+1}{2}$ pairs are constructed from one input image and its $N$ edited versions). Apart from scaling the quantity, this strategy 1) creates mixed-editing training data by combining two edited versions to enhance the training efficiency, and 2) yields inverse pairs to improve data quality, *i.e.*, transforming a real, undistorted input image to an output image.

Paired Images from Videos. Constructing image editing pairs from predefined tasks suffers from limited diversity. To overcome this issue, we leverage naturally grouped images collected from a large scale video frames in our media pool. These images, by sharing inherent relatedness (*e.g.*, common subjects, scenes, or styles), implicitly define complex editing relationships among themselves. Building on this, we refine the data by calculating the cosine similarity between image embeddings using CN-CLIP [^87], allowing us to filter for pairs with high semantic relevance within each image group. The resulting dataset of video frame pairs offers three key advantages: 1) high task diversity, 2) inherent coupling of multiple edit types (*e.g.*, simultaneous changes in human pose and background), and 3) superior scalability.

Rendering for Text Editing. The acquisition of high-quality training data for text editing presents substantial challenges, where natural images suffer from the scarcity and imbalance of textual content, and text editing requires paired samples with precise operation annotations. To address these challenges, we develop a controllable text rendering system [^77] that grants us precise control over not only the textual content but also its visual attributes, such as font, color, size, and position. This approach enables us to systematically generate a large-scale dataset of paired images, where the ground-truth editing instruction are known by the rendering operation, thereby directly overcoming the aforementioned data limitations.

## 3 Image Captioner

Single Image

![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.22699/assets/caption_show_latest.png)

Figure 9: Single image caption and difference caption examples. Left: for single image, we have captions of different types and lengths, and notably, OCR results (all the texts transcribed in their original languages) and world knowledge (explicitly and correctly recognizing the famous beauty spot, West Lake, Hangzhou, China, in this example) is included. Right: difference captions are composed step-by-step.

We build an all-in-one image captioner, Z-Captioner, by incorporating multiple types of image caption. As revealed in previous works [^50], different captioning tasks can benefit each other as they share the same goal of understanding and depicting images. Our model is designed not only to describe visual elements, but also to leverage extensive world knowledge to interpret the semantic context of the image. The integration of world knowledge is particularly critical for the downstream text-to-image synthesis task, as it enables the model to accurately render images involving specific named entities. Figure 8 shows our pipeline for generating text-to-image captions and image editing instructions.

### 3.1 Detailed Caption with OCR Information

First, we specially emphasize that according to our experiments, including explicit OCR information in image captions is inextricably bound with accurate text rendering in the generated images. Therefore, we employ a way that shares the same spirit as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [^74], by first explicitly recognizing all optical characters in the image and then generating a caption based on the OCR results. This effectively mitigates missing texts compared to directly generating a caption that encapsulates everything, especially for the cases where texts are very long/dense. In addition, we force the OCR results to remain in their original languages without any translation, avoiding them being falsely rendered in their translated languages.

### 3.2 Multi-Level Caption with World Knowledge

We design five different types of image captions in total, including long, medium and short captions, as well as tags and simulated user prompts. With the data infrastructure in Section 2, we include world knowledge in all five types of captions by performing image captioning conditioned on meta information. This significantly alleviates hallucinations when our captioner identifies and names specific entities such as public figures, famous landmarks, or known events.

To be specific, for relatively long captions, we include very dense information of the images, in order that the model could learn a mapping from the text to the image as accurate as possible. These captions contain full OCR results as mentioned above, along with subjects, objects, background, location information, et al. We deliberately adopt a plain and objective linguistic style for our descriptions, strictly confining them to factual information observable in the image. By inhibiting subjective interpretations and imaginative associations, our purpose is to enhance data efficiency for the image generation task by eliminating non-essential information.

On the other hand, short captions, tags and simulated user prompts are designed for the model to adapt to real user prompts (which are usually short and unspecific) for better user experience. Notably, most of the simulated user instructions are incomplete prompts. They differ from short captions in that a short caption provides a relatively complete and comprehensive description of the entire image. In contrast, a short simulated prompt may mimic user behavior by focusing only on specific parts of interest to the user, while making no mention of the rest of the image.

### 3.3 Difference Caption for Image Editing

Difference caption is a concise editing instruction specifying the transformation from a source to a target image. To generate this, we employ a three-step CoT process that systematically breaks down the comparative task [^101].

1. Step1: Detailed Captioning. We first generate a comprehensive, OCR-inclusive caption for both the source and target images respectively. This step provides a structured, detailed representation of each image’s content.
2. Step2: Difference Analysis. The model then performs a comparative analysis, leveraging both the raw images and their generated captions, to tell all discrepancies from visual and textual perspectives.
3. Step3: Instruction Synthesis. Finally, the model generates a concise editing instruction based on the identified differences.

This step-by-step process helps the model create clear and useful instructions by moving from understanding, to comparing, and finally to generating the instructions.

## 4 Model Training

This section presents the complete training pipeline of Z-Image and Z-Image-Edit. We begin by introducing our Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture (Section 4.1) and training efficiency optimizations (Section 4.2), followed by a multi-stage training process: pre-training (Section 4.3), supervised fine-tuning (Section 4.4), few-step distillation (Section 4.5), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (Section 4.6). Finally, we describe the continued training strategy for image editing capabilities (Section 4.7) and our reasoning-enhanced prompt enhancer (Section 4.8). The overall training pipeline is summarized in Figure 11. And in Figure 12, we present intermediate generation results throughout Z-Image’s training process to demonstrate the benefits contributed by each stage.

Figure 10: Architecture overview of the Z-Image series. The S3-DiT consists of single-stream FFN blocks and single-stream attention blocks. It processes inputs from different modalities through lightweight modality-specific processors, then concatenates them into a unified input sequence. This modality-agnostic architecture maximizes cross-modal parameter reuse to ensure parameter efficiency, while providing flexible compatibility for varying input configurations in both Z-Image and Z-Image-Edit.

### 4.1 Architecture

Efficiency and stability are the core objectives guiding the design of Z-Image. To achieve this, we employ the lightweight Qwen3-4B [^86] as the text encoder, leveraging its bilingual proficiency to align complex instructions with visual content. For image tokenization, we utilize the Flux VAE [^36] selected for its proven reconstruction quality. Exclusively for editing tasks, we augment the architecture with SigLIP 2 [^70] to capture abstract visual semantics from reference images. Inspired by the scaling success of decoder-only models, we adopt a Single-Stream Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) paradigm [^18]. In this setup, text, visual semantic tokens, and VAE image tokens are concatenated at the sequence level to serve as a unified input stream, maximizing parameter efficiency compared to dual-stream approaches [^18] [^77]. We employ 3D Unified RoPE [^59] [^79] to model this mixed sequence, wherein image tokens expand across spatial dimensions and text tokens increment along the temporal dimension. Crucially, for editing tasks, the reference image tokens and target image tokens are assigned aligned spatial RoPE coordinates but are separated by a unit interval offset in the temporal dimension. Additionally, different time-conditioning values are applied to the reference and target images to distinguish between clean and noisy images.

As illustrated in Figure 10, the specific architecture of our S3-DiT (Scalable Single-Stream DiT) commences with lightweight modality-specific processors, each composed of two transformer blocks for initial modal alignment. Subsequently, tokens enter the unified single-stream backbone. To ensure training stability, we implement QK-Norm to regulate attention activations [^33] [^51] [^24] [^54] and Sandwich-Norm to constrain signal amplitudes at the input and output of each attention / FFN blocks [^16] [^100]. For conditional information injection, input condition vectors are projected into scale and gate parameters to modulate the normalized inputs and outputs of both Attention and FFN layers. To reduce parameter overhead, this projection is decomposed into a low-rank pair: a shared, layer-agnostic down-projection layer followed by layer-specific up-projection layers. Finally, RMSNorm [^92] is uniformly utilized for all the aforementioned normalization operations.

### 4.2 Training Efficiency Optimization

To optimize training efficiency, we implemented a multi-faceted strategy targeting both computational and memory overheads.

For distributed training, we employed a hybrid parallelization strategy. We applied standard Data Parallelism (DP) to the VAE and Text Encoder, as they remain frozen and incur minimal memory footprint. In contrast, for the large DiT model, where optimizer states and gradients consume substantial memory, we utilized FSDP2 [^97] to effectively shard these overheads across GPUs. Furthermore, we implemented gradient checkpointing across all DiT layers. This technique trades an acceptable increase in computational cost for significant memory savings, enabling larger batch sizes and improved overall throughput. To further accelerate computation and optimize memory usage, the DiT blocks were compiled using torch.compile, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler [^1].

In addition to system-level optimizations, we addressed inefficiencies arising from mixed-resolution training. Grouping samples with significantly different sequence lengths into a single batch typically results in excessive padding, which significantly impedes overall training speed. To mitigate this, we designed a sequence length-aware batch construction strategy. Prior to training, we estimate the sequence length of each sample based on the resolution (height and width) recorded in the metadata. The sampler then groups samples with similar sequence lengths into the same batch, thereby minimizing computational waste. Crucially, we additionally employ a dynamic batch sizing mechanism: smaller batch sizes are assigned to long-sequence batches to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors, while larger batch sizes are used for short sequences to avoid resource vacancy. This approach ensures maximal hardware utilization across varying resolutions.

### 4.3 Pre-training

Z-Image is trained using the flow matching objective [^45] [^49], where noised inputs are first constructed through linear interpolation between Gaussian noise $x_{0}$ and the original image $x_{1}$, *i.e.*, $x_{t}=t\cdot x_{1}+(1-t)\cdot x_{0}$. The model is then trained to predict the velocity of the vector field that defines the path between them, *i.e.*, $v_{t}=x_{1}-x_{0}$. The training objective can be formulated as:

$$
\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}_{t,x_{0},x_{1},y}[\|u(x_{t},y,t;\theta)-(x_{1}-x_{0})\|^{2}],
$$

Where $\theta$ as the learnable parameters and $y$ as the conditional embedding. Following SD3 [^18], we employ the logit-normal noise sampler to concentrate the training process on intermediate timesteps. Additionally, to account for the variations in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) arising from our multi-resolution training setup, we adopt the dynamic time shifting strategy as used in Flux [^36]. This ensures that the noise level is appropriately scaled for different image resolutions, leading to more effective training.

The pre-training of Z-Image can be broadly divided into two phases: low-resolution pre-training and omni-pre-training.

Low-resolution Pre-training. This phase consists of a single stage, conducted exclusively at a $256^{2}$ resolution on the text-to-image generation task. The primary emphasis of this stage is on efficient cross-modal alignment and knowledge injection – equipping the model with the capability to generate a diverse range of concepts, styles, and compositions, which is consistent with the initial stage of conventional multi-stage training protocols. As shown in Figure 1, this phase accounts for over half of our total pre-training compute. This allocation is based on the rationale that the majority of the model’s foundational visual knowledge (*e.g.*, Chinese text rendering) is acquired during this low-resolution training stage.

Omni-pre-training. The “omni” here signifies three key aspects:

- Arbitrary-Resolution Training: We design an arbitrary-resolution training strategy in which the original image resolution is mapped to a predefined training resolution range through a resolution-mapping function. The model is then trained on images with diverse resolutions and aspect ratios. This enables the learning of cross-scale visual information, mitigates information loss caused by downsampling to a fixed resolution, and improves overall data efficiency.
- Joint Text-to-Image and Image-to-Image Training: We integrate the image-to-image task into the pre-training framework. By leveraging the substantial compute budget available during pre-training, we can effectively exploit large-scale, naturally occurring, and weakly aligned image pairs, as discussed in Section 2.5. Learning the relationships between natural image pairs provides a strong initialization for downstream tasks such as image editing. Importantly, we observe that this joint pre-training scheme does not introduce any noticeable performance degradation on the text-to-image task.
- Multi-level and Bilingual Caption Training: It is widely recognized that high-quality captions are crucial for training text-to-image models [^4]. To ensure both bilingual understanding and strong native prompt-following capability, we employ Z-Captioner to generate bilingual, multi-level synthetic captions (including long, medium, and short descriptions, as well as tags and simulated user prompts). In addition, the original textual metadata associated with each image is incorporated with a small probability to further enhance the model’s acquisition of world knowledge. The use of captions at different granularities and from diverse perspectives provides broad mode coverage, which is beneficial for subsequent stages of training. Moreover, for image-to-image tasks, we randomly sample either the target image’s caption or the pairwise difference caption with a certain probability, corresponding to reference-guided image generation and multi-task image editing, respectively.

Working with our data infrastructure, the omni-pre-training phase is conducted in multiple stages. Upon completion of the final stage, the model becomes capable of generating images at arbitrary resolutions up to the 1k-1.5k range and can condition its output on both image and text inputs. This provides a suitable starting point for the subsequent training of Z-Image and Z-Image-Edit.

### 4.4 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

##### Distribution Narrowing via High-Quality Alignment.

While the omni-pre-training stage establishes broad world understanding and mode coverage, the resulting distribution inevitably exhibits high variance, reflecting the noisy nature of web-scale data. Consequently, the primary objective of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is not merely to correct local artifacts, but to narrow the generation distribution towards a focused, high-fidelity sub-manifold [^68]. This phase aims for rapid convergence to a fixed distribution characterized by consistent visual aesthetics and precise instruction following. To achieve this, we transition from the noisy supervision of pre-training to a curriculum dominated by highly curated images filtering by our data infrastructure and *super detailed, grounded captions*. This rigorous supervision acts as an anchor, forcing the model to discard low-quality modes (*e.g.*, unstable stylization or inconsistent rendering) and align strictly with detailed textual descriptions, shifting the model from a diversity-maximizing regime to a quality-maximizing operating point.

##### Concept Balancing with Tagged Resampling.

A critical challenge in narrowing the distribution is the risk of catastrophic forgetting, particularly for long-tail concepts that are prone to being overshadowed by dominant modes during convergence. To address this, we enforce strict class balancing throughout the SFT phase. We employ a dynamic resampling strategy guided by world knowledge topological graph in Section 2. Specifically, we maintain a target prior over concepts and utilize BM25-based retrieval to compute rarity scores for training samples on the fly. Mini-batches are constructed by up-weighting under-represented concepts – such as rare entities or specific artistic styles – while down-weighting over-represented ones. This mechanism ensures that while the model converges to the target high-quality distribution, the marginal distribution over concepts remains uniform, effectively preserving the semantic diversity of the pre-trained model.

##### Robustness via Model Merging.

Despite balanced training, SFT on specific high-quality datasets can introduce subtle biases or trade-offs between capabilities (*e.g.*, photorealism vs. stylistic flexibility). To achieve a Pareto-optimal solution without complex inference routing, we employ Model Merging [^76] [^94] as the final refinement step. We fine-tune multiple SFT variants initialized from the same backbone, each slightly biased towards different capability dimensions (*e.g.*, strict instruction following or aesthetic rendering). We then perform a linear interpolation of their weights in the parameter space: $\theta_{\text{final}}=\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}\theta_{i}$. This lightweight merging strategy effectively smooths the loss landscape, neutralizing individual biases and resulting in a final model that exhibits superior stability and robustness across diverse prompts compared to any single SFT checkpoint.

### 4.5 Few-Step Distillation

The goal of the Few-Step Distillation stage is to reduce the inference time of our foundational SFT model, achieving the efficiency demanded by real-world applications and large-scale deployment. While our 6B foundational model represents a significant leap in efficiency compared to larger counterparts, the inference cost remains non-negligible. Due to the inherent iterative nature of diffusion models, our standard SFT model requires approximately 100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs) to generate high-quality samples using Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) [^29]. To bridge the gap between generation quality and interactive latency, we implemented a few-step distillation strategy.

Fundamentally, the distillation process involves teaching a student model to mimic the teacher’s denoising dynamics across fewer timesteps along its sampling trajectory. The core challenge lies in reducing the inherent uncertainty of this trajectory, allowing the student to “collapse” its probabilistic path into a deterministic and highly efficient inference process. Therefore, the key to enable a stable few-step integrator is to meticulously control the distillation process. We initially selected the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) [^89] [^90] paradigm due to its promising performance in academic works. However, in practice, we encountered persistent artifacts such as the loss of high-frequency details and noticeable color shifts – issues that have been increasingly documented by the community. These observations signaled a need for algorithmic refinement. Through a deeper exploration of the distillation mechanism, we gained new insights into the underlying dynamics of DMD, leading to two key technical advancements: Decoupled DMD [^46] and DMDR [^32]. We refer interested readers to the respective academic papers for full technical details. Below, we introduce the practical application of these techniques in building Z-Image-Turbo.

![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.22699/assets/fsd_res.png)

Figure 13: Few-Step Distillation visualization results across different distillation strategies: (a) the original SFT model; (b) Standard DMD; (c) Decoupled DMD (D-DMD); and (d) D-DMD+DMDR ( Z-Image-Turbo ). The proposed approach achieves real-time 8-step inference while attaining superior perceived quality and aesthetic appeal.

#### 4.5.1 Decoupled DMD: Resolving Detail and Color Degradation

Our investigation revealed a core insight: the effectiveness of existing DMD methods is not a monolithic phenomenon but the result of two independent, collaborating mechanisms:

- CFG-Augmentation (CA): This acts as the primary engine driving the distillation process, efficiently building up the few-step generation capabilities of the student model. Despite its dominant role, this factor has been largely overlooked in previous literature.
- Distribution Matching (DM): This functions primarily as a powerful regularizer, ensuring the stability of the training process and removing the emerging artifacts.

By recognizing and decoupling these two mechanisms, we were able to study and optimize them in isolation. This motivation led to the development of Decoupled DMD, an improved distillation framework that features a decoupled application of renoising schedules tailored specifically for the CA and DM terms.

In practice, Decoupled DMD effectively addresses the pain points of traditional DMD, ensuring sharp detail preservation and color fidelity. Notably, the resulting distilled model not only matches the original multi-step teacher but even surpasses it in terms of photorealism and visual impact.

#### 4.5.2 DMDR: Enhancing Capacity with RL and Regularization

To further push the performance boundaries of our few-step model, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning (RL) into the few-step distillation process. Applying RL to generative models typically faces the risk of "reward hacking", where the model exploits the reward function to generate high-scoring but visually nonsensical images. To mitigate this, external regularization is usually required.

Our insight from Decoupled DMD provides a natural solution: since we established that the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a high-quality regularizer, it can be organically combined with RL objectives. This synthesis gives rise to DMDR (Distribution Matching Distillation meets Reinforcement Learning) [^32]. In this framework, RL unlocks the student model’s capacity to align with human preferences, while the DM term acts as a robust constraint, effectively preventing reward hacking. This synergy allows Z-Image-Turbo to achieve superior aesthetic alignment and semantic faithfulness while maintaining strict generative stability.

#### 4.5.3 Results and Analysis

The efficacy of our Decoupled DMD and DMDR distillation strategy is visualized in Figure 13. The original SFT model (a) sets a high baseline but suffers from high latency. Standard DMD (b), while fast, exhibits characteristic degradation: blurred textures and shifted color tones. Our Decoupled DMD (c) successfully resolves these artifacts, restoring sharp details and accurate colors. Finally, Z-Image-Turbo (d), refined via a combination of Decoupled DMD and DMDR, represents the optimal convergence of speed and quality. It achieves 8-step inference that is not only indistinguishable from the 100-step teacher but frequently surpasses it in perceived quality and aesthetic appeal. In summary, our Few-Step Distillation framework resolves the long-standing tension between inference speed and visual fidelity.

### 4.6 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

Following the previous stages, the model has acquired strong foundational capabilities but may still exhibit inconsistencies in aligning with nuanced human preferences. To bridge this gap, we introduce a comprehensive post-training framework leveraging Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). This framework hinges on a powerful, multi-dimensional reward model, which provides targeted feedback for online optimization. Guided by these feedback signals, our approach is structured into two sequential stages: an initial offline alignment phase using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [^60], followed by an online refinement phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [^67] [^47]. This two-stage strategy allows us to first efficiently instill robust adherence to objective standards and then leverage the fine-grained signals from our reward model for optimizing more subjective qualities. As illustrated in Figure 14, this comprehensive process yields substantial improvements in photorealism, aesthetic quality, and instruction following.

#### 4.6.1 Reward Annotation and Training

As an indispensable and critical component of the RLHF pipeline, our reward model is designed to evaluate the model’s performance along three key dimensions: instruction-following capability, AI-Content Detection perception, and aesthetic quality. The reward model is then trained specifically to provide targeted feedback along these axes. For instruction following, we perform syntactic and semantic decomposition of the prompt into a structured hierarchy that includes (i) core subject entities, (ii) attribute specifications, (iii) action or interaction requirements, (iv) spatial or compositional constraints, and (v) stylistic or rendering conditions. During annotation, human raters simply click on the elements that are not satisfied by the model’s output. We then compute the ratio of satisfied elements to obtain the final instruction-following score, which is used as the target reward.

Figure 14: Visual comparison between Few-Step Distillation (FSD, top row) and RLHF (bottom row). Building upon the strong foundation of the FSD model, RLHF further enhances photorealism, aesthetic quality, and instruction following.

#### 4.6.2 Stage 1: Offline Alignment with DPO on Objective Dimensions

While manually curating preference pairs for DPO is feasible for capturing human aesthetic judgments, scaling this process to a large, high-quality dataset presents a significant bottleneck in real practice. Sourcing consistently informative preference pairs across subjective dimensions (*e.g.*, aesthetics, style) is slow and requires extensive expert annotation. To address this scalability challenge and enhance annotation efficiency, our DPO strategy pivots to focus exclusively on objective, verifiable dimensions.

These dimensions, such as text rendering and object counting, offer clear and binary correctness criteria that are highly amenable to automated evaluation by modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). For instance, given a prompt requiring specific text, an image with accurately rendered characters is designated as the positive sample (‘chosen‘), while an image with typographical errors becomes the negative sample (‘rejected‘). We leverage VLMs to programmatically generate a large corpus of such candidate preference pairs. This VLM-generated dataset is then subjected to a streamlined human verification and cleaning process, ensuring high fidelity. This hybrid VLM-human pipeline dramatically increases annotation throughput and consistency compared to purely human manual curation.

Furthermore, to smooth the learning curve, we implement a curriculum learning strategy for DPO training. The process begins with prompts of low complexity (*e.g.*, rendering a single word, generating a small number of objects) and progressively advances to more challenging instructions involving multiple elements, complex layouts, or difficult styles. During this process, we also optimized our pair selection strategy. We observed that DPO’s convergence is sensitive to the differentiation between positive and negative samples. To maximize training efficiency, our curriculum initially prioritizes pairs with moderate differentiation and gradually introduces more challenging pairs exhibiting larger or more subtle differences, which we found accelerate convergence and improve the final performance.

#### 4.6.3 Stage 2: Online Refinement with GRPO

Building upon the robust foundation established by DPO, the second stage employs online reinforcement learning with GRPO. Guided by our reward model, this stage is designed to significantly enhance the model’s capability for photorealistic image generation, alongside improving aesthetic quality and nuanced instruction-following.

During the GRPO training loop, we compute a composite advantage function by aggregating the scores from our reward model (*e.g.*, realism, aesthetics, instruction following, etc.). This multi-faceted feedback mechanism enables targeted, fine-grained optimization [^85]. By providing distinct signals for different aspects of the generation, GRPO can simultaneously enhance photorealistic image generation, aesthetic quality, improve semantic accuracy, and reduce undesirable artifacts. This integrated approach proved to be significantly more effective than optimizing against a single reward, allowing the model to achieve a better balance across multiple, often competing, quality dimensions.

### 4.7 Continued Training for Image Editing

Starting from the base model, the continued pre-training for image editing consists of two stages, as shown in Figure 10. In the continued pre-training stage, we train the model with our constructed editing pairs (see Section 2.5), together with our text-to-image SFT data to ensure high image quality. We first train the whole amount of editing data in resolution of $512^{2}$ for a few thousand steps for quick adaptation to editing tasks, and then increase the image resolution to $1024^{2}$ for high generation quality. Because image editing data pairs are expensive and difficult to acquire, their total volume is significantly smaller and far less diverse than that of text-to-image data. Therefore, we suggest a relatively higher ratio of text-to-image data (*e.g.*, text-to-image:image-to-image $=4:1$) to avoid performance degradation during training.

In the following SFT stage, a task-balanced, high-quality subset of the training data is manually constructed to further improve the model’s overall performance, especially its instruction following ability. However, synthetic data (*e.g.*, the rendered text data for text editing), though easy-to-acquire and guaranteed to be 100% accurate in terms of instruction following, are far from the distribution of real-world user input, and are thus heavily downsampled in this final training stage.

### 4.8 Prompt Enhancer with Reasoning Chain

![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.22699/assets/t2i_pe.png)

Figure 15: PE visualization. We compare generation results between PE without reasoning (middle column) and PE with reasoning (right column). As shown in the top row, the reasoning chain enables the model to decipher raw coordinates into a specific scenic context ( e.g., West Lake) rather than simply rendering the coordinate text. In the second row, the reasoning module plans detailed steps for "brewing Pu-erh tea," allowing the model to generate specific illustrations for each step instead of a generic list. This demonstrates that the reasoning chain effectively injects world knowledge and provides fine-grained content planning for complex user prompts.

Due to limited model size (6B parameters), Z-Image exhibits limitations in world knowledge, intent understanding, and complex reasoning. However, it serves as a powerful text decoder capable of translating detailed prompts into realistic images. To address the cognitive gaps, we propose equipping Z-Image with a Prompt Enhancer (PE), powered by system prompt and a pretrained VLM, to improve its reasoning and knowledge capabilities.

Distinct from other methods, we keep the large VLM fixed during alignment. Instead, we process all input prompts (and input images for Z-Image-Edit) through our PE model during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage. This strategy ensures that Z-Image aligns effectively with the Prompt Enhancer during SFT. Furthermore, we identify the structured reasoning chain as a key factor for injecting reasoning and world knowledge. As shown in Figure 15, without reasoning, the PE merely renders coordinate text onto the image when given geolocation data; with reasoning, it infers the location (*e.g.*, West Lake) to generate the correct scene. Similarly, in generating journal-style instructions, the lack of reasoning leads to monotonous outputs, whereas the reasoning-enhanced model enriches the result by generating specific illustrations for each step.

## 5 Performance Evaluation

### 5.1 Human Preference Evaluation

To rigorously benchmark Z-Image-Turbo’s capabilities against the competitive landscape of generative models, we participated in Alibaba AI Arena <sup>2</sup>, a public-facing, independent benchmarking platform powered by large-scale human judgment. Unlike automated metrics that frequently misalign with human perception, the Arena provides dynamic and unbiased model rankings based on thousands of pairwise comparisons, making it an ideal venue for objective performance assessment.

The evaluation protocol is built upon the Elo rating system – a well-established method for ranking competitors based on head-to-head outcomes. In each round, two images generated from the same text prompt by different models are displayed side-by-side with identities hidden. Evaluators are asked to select the image they perceive as superior in terms of visual coherence, detail rendering, prompt alignment, and artistic quality. Each vote updates the global Elo leaderboard dynamically, ensuring that rankings reflect collective human judgment over time.

In the evaluation, Z-Image-Turbo – our high-efficiency diffusion architecture with 6B parameters and low inference cost of 8 NFEs – competed against 8 leading models, including top-tier closed-source systems: Imagen 4 Ultra Preview 0606 [^26], gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview [^25] (both Google), Seedream 4.0 (ByteDance) [^65], GPT Image 1 \[High\] (OpenAI) [^56], FLUX.1 Kontext \[Pro\] (Black Forest Labs) [^35], and Ideogram 3.0 [^31], along with the open-source baseline Qwen-Image [^77].

As shown in Table 3, Z-Image-Turbo attained an Elo score of 1025, achieving 4th place globally and ranking 1st among open models on the leaderboard <sup>3</sup>. Despite its efficient design, it outperforms multiple industry-leading closed-source models and surpasses Qwen-Image while operating at significantly lower computational cost. With a 45% win rate across all matchups, Z-Image-Turbo demonstrates strong competitiveness against the entire field, including top-tier proprietary systems. This high level of performance positions it firmly within the elite tier of generative models, affirming its status as one of the most advanced open-source systems available.

These results establish Z-Image-Turbo as one of the leading open text-to-image models in terms of both quality and efficiency. More than a high-performing generator, it represents a new baseline for efficiency-oriented architecture design, demonstrating that compact models can achieve elite-level performance without compromising usability. This combination of speed, fidelity, and openness enables deployment in resource-constrained environments, interactive applications, and community-driven innovation.

#### 5.1.2 Human Preference Comparison with Flux 2 dev

To benchmark our Z-Image model against the latest state-of-the-art open-source model, Flux 2 dev [^37], we conducted an additional user study. The study involved evaluating a set of 222 samples generated by Z-Image and Flux 2 dev with user-style prompts. Each sample was assessed by three independent annotators to ensure robustness and reduce bias in the evaluation process. The results, as summarized in Table 4, demonstrate a significant advantage for Z-Image model. Specifically, the "G Rate" (i.e., Good Rate) achieve 46.4%, indicating a high proportion of satisfactory generations. Concurrently, the “S Rate” (i.e., Same Rate) is 41.0%. Consequently, the combined “G+S Rate” reached an impressive 87.4%, suggesting that Z-Image consistently produces high-quality or acceptable outputs from user prompts. In contrast, the “B Rate” (i.e., Bad Rate) was only 12.6%. Remarkably, these superior results were achieved with Z-Image having only 1/5 of the parameters compared to Flux 2 dev (6B vs. 32B parameters).

### 5.2 Quantitative Evaluation

To comprehensively evaluate the generation and editing capabilities of Z-Image and its variants (Z-Image-Turbo and Z-Image-Edit), we conducted extensive experiments across multiple authoritative benchmarks. These evaluations cover general image generation, fine-grained instruction following, text rendering in both English and Chinese, and instruction-based image editing.

#### 5.2.1 Text-to-Image Generation

##### CVTG-2K.

To evaluate our model’s performance on text rendering tasks, we conduct quantitative experiments on the CVTG-2K benchmark [^17]. CVTG-2K is a specialized benchmark designed for Complex Visual Text Generation, encompassing diverse scenarios with varying numbers of text regions. As presented in Table 5, our model achieves superior performance on CVTG-2K across all evaluation metrics. Specifically, Z-Image attains the highest average Word Accuracy score of 0.8671, outperforming competitive baselines such as GPT-Image-1 [^56] (0.8569) and Qwen-Image [^77] (0.8288). Notably, our model demonstrates robust performance across varying levels of complexity, maintaining consistent accuracy even as the number of text regions increases from 2 to 5. Furthermore, Z-Image-Turbo, our efficient variant, achieves the highest CLIP Score of 0.8048 among all models while maintaining competitive text accuracy (0.8585 average Word Accuracy), striking an effective balance between generation quality and inference efficiency.

#### 5.2.2 Instruction-based Image Editing

ImgEdit. Table 14 shows the evaluation of Z-Image-Edit on the ImgEdit Benchmark [^88], where the metric combines instruction completion and visual quality. Across 9 common editing tasks, Z-Image-Edit shows competitive editing performance with leading models, especially object addition and extraction.

GEdit. We also evaluate Z-Image-Edit on the GEdit-Bench [^48], which evaluates visual naturalness (G\_PQ) and bilingual instruction following (G\_SC). GEdit-Bench-EN abd GEdit-Bench-CN adopt English and Chinese instructions in the evaluation, respectively. As shown in Table 15, Z-Image-Edit achieves 3rd rank, demonstrating robust bilingual editing capabilities.

### 5.3 Qualitative Evaluation

To further demonstrate the visual generation capacity of Z-Image <sup>4</sup>, we first give the qualitative comparison against state-of-the-art open-source models (Lumina-Image 2.0 [^59], Qwen-Image [^77], HunyuanImage 3.0 [^8], and FLUX 2 dev [^37]) and close-source models (Imagen 4 Ultra [^26], Seedream 4.0 [^65] and Nano Banana Pro [^27]). We then show the editing capacity of our Z-Image-Edit. We next show the examples of how reasoning capacity and world knowledge are injected by our prompt enhancer. We finally show that the emerging multi-lingual and multi-cultural understanding capacity of our Z-Image.

#### 5.3.1 Superior Photorealistic Generation

As shown in Figure 16 and 17, Z-Image-Turbo shows excellent character close-up generation (*e.g.*, the skin details on a man’s face and a girl’s tears). When asked to generate multi-expression portraits of one person (Figure 18), Z-Image-Turbo can produce images that are more aesthetically pleasing and have more realistic expressions, while Qwen-Image, HunyuanImage3.0, FLUX 2 dev, and Seedream 4.0 would sometimes generate exaggerated and unrealistic expressions, thus lacking authenticity and beauty. Moreover, when generating a scene captured by a mobile phone (Figure 19 and 20), Z-Image-Turbo shows strong performance in the authenticity of both the person and the background, as well as the aesthetic appeal of layout and posture. while Qwen-Image, HunyuanImage3.0, and FLUX 2 dev would generate unrealistic things (*e.g.*, clothes that remain completely unsoaked in the heavy rain).

#### 5.3.2 Outstanding Bilingual Text Rendering

Figure 21 and Figure 22 show the qualitative comparison of Chinese and English text rendering. As shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22, Z-Image-Turbo accurately rendered the required text while maintaining the aesthetic appeal and authenticity of other parts (*e.g.*, the authenticity of the human face in Figure 21 and the layout of the scene in Figure 22). Note that this is comparable to the leading closed-source model Nano Banana Pro, and surpasses other candidates. When rendering text in poster design (Figure 23 and Figure 24), Z-Image-Turbo not only presents correct text rendering, but also designs a more aesthetically pleasing and realistic poster. For example, as shown in Figure 24), Qwen-Image, HunyuanImage3.0, FLUX 2 dev, and Imagen 4 Ultra make errors when rendering very small characters, Seedream4.0 and Nano Banana Pro make errors of repeatedly rendering the text, while Z-Image-Turbo gets the poster with the right rendered text and satisfactory design.

#### 5.3.3 Instruction-following Editing

The first two columns of Figure 25 demonstrates the ability of Z-Image-Edit to handle complex composite prompts. For example, the top simultaneously switches the background to the Sydney Opera House, inserting a specific object (a sign reading “Z-Image”), and removing the character’s backpack. The bottom row also illustrates precise control over multiple subjects. The last two columns of Figure 25 also illustrates that Z-Image-Edit can accurately modify textual content according to a bounding-box–based location constraint (left) and keep characters consistent when transforming the image (right).

#### 5.3.4 Enhanced Reasoning Capacity and World Knowledge through Prompt Enhancer

As demonstrated in Figure 15 and Figures 26-27, our prompt enhancer leverages a structured reasoning chain – comprising core subject analysis, problem solving/world knowledge injection, aesthetic enhancement, and comprehensive description – to equip the model with logical reasoning and world knowledge capabilities. This allows the model to handle diverse tasks, ranging from solving complex logical puzzles (*e.g.*, the chicken-and-rabbit problem) and interpreting user intent (*e.g.*, visualizing classical poetry or inferring scenes from coordinates) to performing text rendering and question answering.

In the context of image editing, prompt enhancer is also crucial for addressing ambiguous or unclear intentions, as well as for injecting world knowledge and enabling reasoning, similar to how it functions in text-to-image generation, as shown in Figure 28-29. For example, in Figure 29, the wrong dish is made because of a lack of reasoning about the relationship between the ingredients and the dish, while prompt enhancer can make up for this.

#### 5.3.5 Emerging Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Understanding Capacity

After trained with bilingual data, we are surprised to find that Z-Image has initially emerged with the ability to handle multilingual input. As shown in Figure 30, Z-Image can not only understand prompts in multiple languages but also generate images that align with local cultures and landmarks.

## 6 Conclusion

In this report, we introduce the Z-Image series, a suite of high-performance 6B-parameter models built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT). Challenging the prevailing “scale-at-all-costs” paradigm, we propose a holistic end-to-end solution anchored by four strategic pillars: (1) a curated, efficient data infrastructure; (2) a scalable single-stream architecture; (3) a streamlined training strategy; and (4) advanced optimization techniques for high-quality and efficient inference, encompassing PE- aware supervised fine-tuning, few-step distillation, and reward post-training.

This synergy allows us to complete the entire workflow within 314K H800 GPU hours at a total cost of under $630K, delivering top-tier photorealistic synthesis and bilingual text rendering. Beyond the robust base model, our pipeline yields Z-Image-Turbo, which enables sub-second inference (<1s) on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and fits comfortably within 16G VRAM consumer-grade hardware. Additionally, we develop Z-Image-Edit, an editing model efficiently derived via our omni-pretraining paradigm. Through this pipeline, we provide the community with a blueprint for developing accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.
